# Database
Please note that I am using MYSQL database for all this project and consider using the same
to avoid incompatibility issue. 

# There is also a frontend implemented in REACTJS
What is React summary?
React is a JavaScript-based UI development library. 
Facebook and an open-source developer community run it. 
Although React is a library rather than a language, it is widely used in web development. 
The library first appeared in May 2013 and is now one of the most commonly used frontend libraries for web development.


# What are we going to use REACT for in our spring boot project ?
  1. To implement a simple product management application
  2. The frontend will use React and the backend will use Spring boot
  3. We'll use axios js, a promise based library that will help us fetch our API
  4. We will also set the cross-origin in our spring boot application to enabled smooth communication
     between the back and front end using the @CrossOrigin annotation
  5. This application is for practical purpose only
